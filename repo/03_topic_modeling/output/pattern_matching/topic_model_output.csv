This year, we will not stay the course necessarily, for we elect a new president. Some people believe electing one particular candidate will, in essence, be staying the course, though that candidate has done much to draw distinctions between herself and her predecessor. Others believe electing another of the primary candidates will lead the nation in a new, more prosperous direction.

This allowed time for the electors to travel to the official meeting of the Electoral College to officially cast their votes. Because of this, November became the time for the populous election because it would have been after the harvest and before most of the severe winter weather that would impede transportation. Tuesday was selected as Election Day so that voters could attend church on Sunday, travel to the polling location on Monday, vote on Tuesday, and be home on Wednesday, when farmers would typically sell their produce at market. With the advent of the telegraph, and the onset of nearly instant national communication, a fear arose that one state might influence another state in Presidential electoral outcomes. So Congress in 1845 mandated a uniform national date for elections. The first Tuesday after the first Monday in November."
