Does this phenomenon pose a problem for you or do you believe in the absolute right of a woman to terminate a pregnancy because the unborn fetus is female? 3. In many states, a teenager can have an abortion without her parents' consent or knowledge but cannot get an aspirin from the school nurse without parental authorization. Do you support any restrictions or parental notification regarding abortion access for minors? 4. If you do not believe that human life begins at conception, when do you believe it begins? At what stage of development should an unborn child have human rights? 5. Currently, when genetic testing reveals an unborn child has Down Syndrome, most women choose to abort. How do you answer the charge that this phenomenon resembles the eugenics movement a century ago the slow, but deliberate weeding out of those our society would deem unfit to live? 6. Do you believe an employer should be forced to violate his or her religious conscience by providing access to abortifacient drugs and contraception to employees? 7. Alveda King, niece of Martin Luther King, Jr. has said that abortion is the white supremacist's best friend, pointing to the fact that Black and Latinos represent 25 of our population but account for 59 of all abortions. How do you respond to the charge that the majority of abortion clinics are found in inner-city areas with large numbers of minorities? 8. You describe abortion as a tragic choice. If abortion is not morally objectionable, then why is it tragic? Does this mean there is something about abortion that is different than other standard surgical procedures? 9. Do you believe abortion should be legal once the unborn fetus is viable able to survive outside the womb? 10. If a pregnant woman and her unborn child are murdered, do you believe the criminal should face two counts of murder and serve a harsher sentence?"

Wade decision in 1973, over 59 million babies have been killed by abortion in the U.S. The clearest path to altering this murderous tally is to have justices appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court who will overturn Roe V. Wade. Homosexual activity condemned in Romans 1:26-32. It tarnishes both the individual soul and society at large. The best of hope for a change in the law on this issue again relies on the make up of the Supreme Court. In such matters, the Christian has an obligation to stand up for that which is right.
