"Without the direction of the Holy Spirit, this concern can easily turn to slander, for some times there is a fine line between voicing a concern and gossip, and between help and hurt. George Bush the first made a trip to Australia during his term in office, when getting off the plane he decided to flash the reporters, tv crews and bystanders what he thought was the peace sign. What he accomplished was flying the entire nation the bird."
"Do you have certain expectations because of your authority, position or wealth. Trust me in this, when you, me, Bill Gates or President Bush die; we all get eaten by the same type of worms. 4."
"OK, ask your relatives to help you, I have my own problems. Ha, I remember Joe Biden gafe during an electoral meeting, asking a guy in wheel chair to stand up. Apply... church-sinner-insensitive speaker/pastor... I am sure that the crippled beggar knew about Jesus."
"What we need, most of all, is to be sensitive enough to see our opportunities, and to be close enough to God that we will then choose to use our energy, our personality, our money, and our influence to make a difference, to be a peace maker. Peace goes beyond political systems, it goes beyond whether Obama or McCain or anyone else will bring peace to the Middle East, let alone in our own country. It goes beyond issues of wealth, culture and intellect."
"THE FORGIVEN FOREBEAR COLOSSIANS 3:12-14 It's been alleged that the Republican party will spend 150,000 on Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin's wardrobe and makeup. Senator Hillary Clinton's pantsuits were donated to her. They cost 6,200."
"They cost 6,200. John McCain wears 500 shoes. Paul tells us every well-dressed Christian has forgiveness and forbearance as an essential part of his wardrobe."
"Now, in our day when moral standards have been so eroded, it is hard to imagine how nonbelievers would be shocked by any type of sexual immorality. During the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, there were folks who said, What's the big deal. Everyone has extramarital sex and lies about it."
"--when candidates announce they are running for office, they do it in a special place. 6 years ago Obama announced over in Springfield in front of the capitol building. You'd think Jesus would work His first miracle, proving He is God, in imperial Rome, or intellectual Alexandria, or religious Jerusalem."
"In God we trust. If I could find something good in Obama's election victory it might be that it put to death a real danger which loomed, in Christian America, of developing an attitude of 'In Romney we trust. Instead, many now are saying, what are we gonna do for the next four years."
"I don't know if you've figured out who that interview was with. But it was conducted by a Chicago Sun-Times religion reporter on March 27, 2004 as she sat down in a local coffee shop with then State Senator Barack Obama. Why do I tell you about that."
"Either God's people return to God w/ all our hearts, or God will judge our nation Henry Blackaby - Friend of mine I were talking about the election. Texted him: Either way Trump or Biden I believe judgment is coming, evil is going to continue to increase, the love of most will grow cold, 2 Tim 3 4 will become more more evident. I believe we've gone past the point of no return our kids grandkids are going to face unimaginable evil."
"6 THE SIGNATURE By Christ Jesus. A My check My signature Rockefeller's signature Donald Trump'ssignature. Jesus gives us a blank check with His signature on it and says, Just fill it inwith what you need, and I will provide it for you."
"15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. 16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. 18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words."
"A one world movement has been in place for decades, a one world church, a one world economy, and a one world government is right on its heels. Many Americans rejoiced at the news of Obama's victory this week, but they weren't the only ones. Many more around the world are touting him as the President of the World, a major international healer, bringing all together."
"And we would sit here this evening and say that Christians DON'T live a life that is a carbon copy of unbelieving Americans Yet the statistics would not bear witness to that statement The divorce rate is virtually the same between Christians and non-Christians as a matter of fact; I saw one report that showed the divorce rate among Christians to be just a little higher than non-Christians What kind of testimony is that to world that is looking for something to make a difference in their lives Christians watch the same movies and television programs Where is the salt and the light where are the people standing in the gap to save our families and our nation This year, we have seen Homosexual unions become legal in one state in our nation And the lawsuits have been filed in other states to make those unions legal nationwide Where does the worldview lie. On June 3rd of this year, the Arkansas Democratic Gazette had a letter to the editor from pastor Randy McCain from Sherwood, who said that he was proud to be the pastor of a homosexual man. He went on to add that he could say with all honesty that this mans lifestyle is one of helping others and caring for those around him."
"That's pretty scary. Not one major newspaper has endorsed Donald Trump. That's never happened before."
"Jesus tells us to come into His courts. Not the courts of Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton or Bob Johnson or anyone else. God wants you to know Him."
"But over the past decade and a half, each of the 30 states to consider constitutional amendments that would outlaw such unions have adopted the ban from Alaska in 1998 to North Carolina earlier this year. That may change on Election Day, when voters in Maryland, Washington, Maine and Minnesota awash in money, messages and advertisements from both sides of the issue will make their decision on whether to recognize gay marriage It will be the first major test since President Obama in May became the first president to publicly state his support for gay marriage. This week, Obama also personally endorsed ballot measures in Maine, Maryland and Washington state that would legalize gay marriage; he has previously expressed opposition to efforts in Minnesota to pass a constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriage."

This week, Obama also personally endorsed ballot measures in Maine, Maryland and Washington state that would legalize gay marriage; he has previously expressed opposition to efforts in Minnesota to pass a constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriage. I am thankful that 30 states have seen fit to adopt constitutional amendment's in support of traditional marriage and it is my hope that in the six states this year where same-sex marriage is being voted on that they will be defeated but whether they are or not there is only one definition of marriage that counts and it is the definition found in Genesis 2:Genesis 2:20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him."
"To show us that he knows our pain. Do you remember in the 1992 presidential election, Bill Clinton was known for saying, I feel your pain. This simple statement endured itself to millions of Americans who at the time believed that George Bush could not relate to the experiences of the average American."
"Do you remember in the 1992 presidential election, Bill Clinton was known for saying, I feel your pain. This simple statement endured itself to millions of Americans who at the time believed that George Bush could not relate to the experiences of the average American. Bush didn't even know the price of a gallon of milk after all."
"Bush didn't even know the price of a gallon of milk after all. It was no accident that Bill Clinton chose those words, for he knew that deep within us all, we desire to know that out there somewhere, there is someone who understands how we feel and what we are going through. Bill Clinton understood the power of shared suffering."
"It was no accident that Bill Clinton chose those words, for he knew that deep within us all, we desire to know that out there somewhere, there is someone who understands how we feel and what we are going through. Bill Clinton understood the power of shared suffering. But Bill Clinton wasn't the first to discover this."
"Bill Clinton understood the power of shared suffering. But Bill Clinton wasn't the first to discover this. In fact, God knew this all along."
"Unfortunately, meekness isn't a valued quality in our day. The world's philosophy of success says be assertive, no, do more than be assertive, go to the Donald Trump school of success and be aggressive. go for the throat."
"Monica Lewinsky is a name known by many. She is the former White House intern who had a scandalous affair with President Bill Clinton in the late 1990s. Since then, Lewinsky has lived in the shadow of public shame."

Some of the most exciting periods of our lives are times of anticipation."
"Nov 9 - 12,000 still without power- 11/6/12 - An election that for many did not turn out right, Victoria Jackson - The former Saturday Night Live comedienne - I can't stop crying America died. , Donald Trump - We can't let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty."
". A few weeks ago, President Clinton spent Saturday and Sunday huddling with his lawyers preparing for his grand jury testimony. As I thought about that, it seemed a bit odd."
"We ought to look forward to the coming of Christiii. The Rescue of the Rapture - 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18 - 16For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: 17Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. 18Wherefore comfort one another with these words."
"In this question Justice Roberts is pointing to an eventual conflict that would occur. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, representing the Obama Administration and his Department of Justice, arguing in favor of nationwide gay marriage responded like this: That is going to depend on how the States work out the balance between their civil rights laws different states could strike different balances. First I want you to notice, he did not say no to the question."
"15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. 16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: 17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. 18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words."
"2 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. 1 Th 4:16 - 18 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

"Jesus began His earthly mission with a search for a team of apprentices, of high level leaders who would form his inner circle and take on the leadership of building His Kingdom after he completed His mission here on earth. As was depicted in the drama sketch, the men Jesus chose were not the type of people who would rise to the top of an Apprentice series to be selected by Donald Trump. Jesus was choosing a team to join Him in building a Kingdom here on earth that would alter the course of human history and stand forever."
"In the past couple of weeks, news reports have come out that Newt Gingrich was having an adulterous affair with one of his staff members while he served as Speaker of the House. Bill Bennett gave a powerful rebuke to those Republicans who were very critical of Bill Clinton's behavior, but refuse to criticize Gingrich's behavior. Bennett, a leader in the Republican Party, said men and women of principle need to be willing to condemn dishonest and immoral behavior no matter in which party it occurs."
"Now, I'm not going to touch the political issues. Whether or not it was wise to vote for Clinton or Gingrich, whether or not they should have been removed from office for what they did, are political questions which I'm not going to try to answer for anyone. But, I will say that the actions of both men have been morally disgusting and disgraceful."
"The polls back this up as 71 of seniors say they are stressed and half of all adults are experiencing anxiety during this election season. On the other end of the age spectrum, according to one study, 1 in 4 millennials would rather the earth get hit by a giant meteor strike than have Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton in the White House. Here are some words that describe what many are feeling fear, anger, disgust, distrust, frustration, embarrassment, and hostility."
"Everything the church does, every energy that it expends, needs to be pointed toward this one thing ... redeeming and completing human beings. To paraphrase Bill Clinton's famous poster, It's the people, stupid. The seductive thing, you see, about church is that it is so easy to get lost in its activities and its traditions."

"They came from all over the country from all walks of life, the best and brightest of what America has to offer: attorneys, stockbrokers, executives, and entrepreneurs. Those who watch the show become acquainted with these candidates and select their own favorites while Trump decides by the process of elimination-- AKA firing candidates each week in the board room--who he will select as one of his inner circle, his leaders, his apprentice.

"A musician spends 3/4ths of a song talking about sinful living and in the middle somewhere puts Jesus or church and people of faith bless it and say he or she is Christian. Recently at a fundraiser, president Obama introduced Bruce Springsteen and Jazee as entertainers who represent what America has become. Jazee's song I don't call it music was filled with filth, the N word, the F word, replace B word with Mitt, talked about Ho's and this is a Presidential fundraiser, with people who represent what America has become."
"Last week we began this brief series I've entitled The Apprentice: The Type of Person God Chooses. The Apprentice is of course the TV reality show centered around Donald Trump in which 18 candidates arrive on scene for a 15 week job interview. They are put through all kinds of challenges, situations and competitions so that Trump through the process of elimination known as firing in the board room each week selects one to be his apprentice to work with him in building his Trump kingdom."

"But we are not here to talk about a TV show or Trump's huge empire or ego. We are here to talk about another man who has more power and influence than Donald Trump could ever dream of. Almost 2000 years ago Jesus of Nazareth began a three year venture of building a Kingdom here on earth that would alter the course of human history and would stand forever."
"But for it to be right and wrong, we have to have a will, and we have to be able to choose between the two From ElightenNext Magazine, The God we believe in is the God of all peoples.

Background to passage: this is the conclusion to Paul's message to the Areopagus on Mars Hill."
"After all, who is telling the truth. Is McCain. Is Obama."
"Is McCain. Is Obama. It seems to me, elections have developed into who is a better expert in spinning the truth."
"You see Today's truth seems to depend on the spin. We have been listening to ads on TV over the last few weeks, and whether it is Krysan or Lee, Mesi or Ranzenhofer, or Obama or McCain we struggle to know what the truth really is and who is telling it. Each side continually accuses the other of lies."
"It is our choice. ILL Truth S Many have considered Bill Clinton the first postmodern president. It seemed that he was always reinventing himself to adapt to the moment."
"He was an expert at manipulating words to his favor. George Stephanopoulos, now an ABC news analyst was the Director of Communications for Bill Clinton's White House. When reporters hounded him about Clintonian lies, Stephanopoulos accused them of an excess of literalism."
"When reporters hounded him about Clintonian lies, Stephanopoulos accused them of an excess of literalism. Stephanopoulos, to his credit, did tire of the Clinton lies and left the White House. CHALLENGE:Finding the truth, and acting on it, is an old problem."
"There are 4900 friends on my page. If you voted Biden say so. If not unfriend me."
"And hope is what the church, when we're at our best can offer the world. It's not hope in Trump or Biden or anyone else. It's not hope in a political party."
"It says, the powers that be are ordained of God. Did you know that George Bush was not put into the Presidency by the Supreme Court. You hear that in the media over and over again."
"God put him there. Just like he put President Clinton and President Regan and President Carter there. Just like He's going to put our next president there."

"5b. So they set a trap for him knowing that his love for God would trump anything else in this world. I want you to get this."
"We will pray for our newly elected political leaders to listen to the voice of God that many of them have silenced in their hearts. We will especially pray for Barack Obama, that he will not follow through on his promise to remove all restrictions on abortion, but rather embrace the gift of life. We will even pray for our enemies, for terrorists and those whose greed has brought our nation to its economic knees that they be converted and live."
"We must rely on the grace of Christ to carry us through, and His sacramental presence and consolation. What if it gets worse as Biden and Harris have promised it would and lasts for four years or eight or the rest of our lives, God forbid. The Ephesus church also had a third attaboy from St."
"C. surrounded by officials and President Bill Clinton she declared I feel that the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion. It is a direct war against the child, a direct killing of an innocent child."
"Political leaders claim Christian -but don't affect their politics. v5 Abortion, Gambling,Both Candidates for President claim to be followers of Jesus, but one said... Presidental candidates name not used In Obama's Own WordsBarryAFrom the responses to a Q A sent out by Nature here. Do you believe that evolution by means of natural selection is a sufficient explanation for the variety and complexity of life on Earth."
"Should intelligent design, or some derivative thereof, be taught in science class in public schools. Obama: I believe in evolution, and I support the strong consensus of the scientific community that evolution is scientifically validated. I do not believe it is helpful to our students to cloud discussions of science with non-scientific theories like intelligent design that are not subject to experimental scrutiny."
"Thomas was pastor of Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church, which saw its building in New Orleans flooded following Hurricane Katrina. The church did not have flood insurance and received a 252,000 federal disaster loan and a 35,000 grant from the Bush-Clinton Katrina fund. Prosecutors said Thomas deposited the 35,000 into a bank account he controlled, along with the initial 10,000 loan payment."
"When I read about this, I thought it's a point of light. Do you remember how President George Bush sr. used this phrase in his speeches."
"Consider a few examples1. Annie Howard In 1991 she was awarded one of President Bush's Thousand Points of Light awards for her Prison Fellowship volunteer work in the Kentucky Correctional Institute for Women. Holds choir practice in the prison chapel, has an evening Bible study, hosts a dinner for 6 volunteers in her home all in an evening."
"She feels the battle for people's souls like a battle between darkness and light. The award Annie received from President Bush is a heavy medallion with a stylized candle on it. Its on a gold chain, designed to be worn around her neck."
"Those fighting for reform in education see areas where the system is malformed. John McCain and Barrack Obama are both running as candidates of change, but no person in human history has ever called men and women to the depth of reform and change that Jesus of Nazareth has called us to. And Jesus is proof positive that people are okay with political reform, okay with educational reform, okay with institutional reform, okay with legal reform, okay with financial reform, okay with ethical reform, but most people even most people who say they follow Jesus reject out of hand that it is not politics, not education, not institutions, not the law, not finance and not ethics that need reform, but rather it is the human heart that needs reform that needs transformation that needs to be changed, brought from the place where we now stand as we have been formed through our lives up to now and worked over."
"What all the news commentators seemed to find noteworthy was how civilized our country is when it comes to elections. When it was all over John Kerry called President bush and conceded the election. He admitted defeat and wished him well."
"Me: The election was just under two weeks ago, and it wasn't my intention to address it, other than to say that we need to continue to pray for our country and our leaders. But to be honest, I've heard a lot of comments over the last two weeks about how ugly the election was and how the end of the world is upon us because the abortion ban failed and because Senator Obama was elected president. I gotta tell you that I personally haven't lost a lot of sleep about it."
"I'm not blind to the fact that the policies of Mr. Obama are contrary to what most of us believe to be biblical standards of morality and freedom. But I really doubt that he or a liberal congress is going to be able to completely destroy the constitution during his term in office."
"Support our leaders. Senator McCain pointed out that during the election Senator Obama was his rival, but on January 20th, Senator Obama will be his president. That's the case for all of us."
"After years of faithful service, his efforts began to really make difference, not only in the lives of children but in the community as well. Due to the success of Metro's programs, President George Bush, Sr. appointed Pastor Bill to serve on the National Commission on America's Urban Families in 1991."
"Let me end by relating a story I came across while I was researching for this message. I've heard that when President Bush was governor of Texas he had to deal with a lot of conflict. He came into office with a legislature that was in the opposite party."
". Obama Wins. November 9th, 20081 Peter 2:13-17; Romans 13:1-7Obama wins."
"This couldn't have happened without the Christian vote. Some voted for Obama simply because he is black and that is as racists as the one who didn't vote for him because he is black. Some Christians, with their vote, unwittingly promoted the anti-Christian agenda."
"Let's honor the king. Barack Obama is our king. He is our president."
"I was way off. I thought Romney would win in a landslide. With broken promises, high unemployment, economic woes, deficient sky high and the lies and deception of Libya I didn't think there was any way the majority of American's would vote for Obama."
"I thought Romney would win in a landslide. With broken promises, high unemployment, economic woes, deficient sky high and the lies and deception of Libya I didn't think there was any way the majority of American's would vote for Obama. I didn't realize how effective his negative campaigning worked and how unaware, uninformed and uneducated the majority of the American public is."
"We will reap the consequences of our choices. One of the members of the liberal media said, Mitt Romney lost the election because he couldn't separate himself from the Republican Party's growing extremism. Do you know what he was referring to."
"Let's call it for what it is baby killing. And Obama recently signed into law a bill that allowed, not only partial birth abortion but that the baby could be killed if it is alive outside the womb. God says that is an abomination."
"The headlines read, Voters largely blamed the recession on President George W. Bush, which ultimately helped President Barack Obama in his bid for a second term. No one ever says that in Bush's last two years he had a democratic controlled House and Senate."
"Non-whites made up 28 percent of the electorate, up a bit from 27 percent in 2008. This group largely backed Obama: 71 percent of Hispanics it was 67 percent last time , and 93 percent of blacks down a touch from 95 percent. Our leaders ought to be bringing our country together instead of pitting the poor against the rich and people of color against whites."
"After interjecting to give some final thoughts, somebody off-screen could be heard saying ooo at that remark. The MSNBC host ended election coverage by saying he's glad the storm hit, suggesting it served a greater good by boosting President Obama to a second term. That is Rousseau's philosophy in reality."
"A good teacher inspires a thirst for learning that lasts a lifetime. Bill Clinton said that on August 5, 1993 during a ceremony honoring inductees into the teacher's Hall of Fame. Henry Brooks Adams said, Teachers affect eternity, they can never know the full range of their influence."
"In the presidential race especially, election day is also a day of punishments and rewards for those who are helping out the candidates. If you were on George Bush's campaign staff, election day for you is a day of rewards. You'll be congratulated for all your hard work, and you'll probably be given a job in the government somewhere that's your reward, if you want it, for working on the campaign for the winner."
"When you watch reality television shows like the Apprentice or Survivor - you can see people that are full of confidence. In the recent presidential debates you can tell that neither George Bush or John Kerry are lacking confidence. There's lots of confident people in the world."
"The difference between the Donald Trumps and the Davids is easy to see however. Donald Trump seems to be confident in his ability and his decision making ability. But David's confidence had a completely different source."
"We worry about our freedoms when the political winds change. Will Joe Biden and the Democrats clamp down on Christian freedom and condemn Biblical doctrines as hate speech. Or will we be able to maintain our freedoms to worship."
"There are no ifs about itKings are not like Presidents. President Bush needed the approval of the majority of the American people to be elected as President. He - to a point - had to tell us what we wanted to hear - things like, I'll protect you, lower your taxes, and protect human life."
"The search is on for financial empires. We see many like Donald Trump and Bill Gates seeking a kingdom through corporate takeovers, mergers, and buyouts. Many are striving to make six figured salaries either by working for ATT, Bell Atlantic or the local drug dealer."
"The fat cats in congress could take a lesson from David and show some mercy. President Clinton could take a lesson from David, if really wants a reasonable, bipartisan, response to his plight. He would show mercy on those all those sitting on Death Row and change his views on the death penalty- if he really wanted a demonstration in mercy."
"The nice thing about America is that there is not going to be a Civil War now. President Bush is not going to get revenge on these people who voted against him, and the Kerry supporters aren't going to start a rebellion. They may complain and lobby against his decisions - and they probably will."
"Many people today are afraid of what will happen this Tuesday. O Lord ... what will happen if Obama is elected. O Lord ... what will happen if McCain is elected."
"O Lord ... what will happen if Obama is elected. O Lord ... what will happen if McCain is elected. Some are even worried about what will happen in the local races."
"So.... McCain, Obama, Nader. It may not matter as much as we fear."
"It was his contention that every American should own their own home, whether or not they could afford it. When Clinton got into office, he supercharged the process. He put in place new rules and regulations, which gave Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac extraordinary leverage, allowing them to hold just 2."
"mortgage market.

"When their breath departs, they return to the earth; on that very day their plans perish. In the words of one of my colleagues from a blog post this week, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are not gods. And I might add that neither is Barack Obama, or the Bushes, or any others."
"In the words of one of my colleagues from a blog post this week, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are not gods. And I might add that neither is Barack Obama, or the Bushes, or any others. But this fellow pastor goes on, The DNC and GOP are not your community."
"Those who lost start thinking about 2012; those who won wonderwhat in the world they've gotten themselves in-for. Bill Clinton talked about that; after an improbable victory in 1991. On inauguration day in January 1992 he is said to have been walking in the parade to the White House thinking, O-my-gosh."
"Some of the greatest leaders have fallen because ofit. Visions come to mind of some recent ones;Sadaam, of course,Richard Nixon declaring that he was not a crook Bill Clinton pointing his finger into the cameras and defending his honor about what he didn't do with that woman. From whence cometh power."
"We need to give Mr. Obama a healthy dose ofrespect and honor; it is due his office, and we must be respectful and helpful citizens. Paul the Apostle reminded us:1Let every person be subject to the governing authorities; for there is no authority except from God, and thoseauthorities that exist have been instituted by God."
"I heard Mr. Obama give thanks to his Grandma, sisters and brothers, campaign manager and strategistsI heard him give thanks to the American people. But I heard no thanks to God."
"But will he lead us in the direction of God. I heard him say that he wants to work with Senator McCain and Governor Palin. But does he want to bring God into the strategy session."
"Step aside, Warren Buffet. Donald Trump, You're fired, because in Christ I own the world. You see, when you trust Christ with your life, you are not only a child of God."
"Survivor and Big Brother rely on alliances and they thrive off the mistakes and mis-steps of others, and when these things happen the person who made the mistake is ganged up on and voted off the island or out of the house. Each week on the apprentice the teams are given different challenges and those who perform poorly are sent to the board room where they attempt to sort out the weakest member, and Donald Trump utters the famous words Your Fired. Yes these are games and mercy is really not built into the rules of the game, mercy is not rewarded by the game but then again it isn't against the rules either."
"I know, I know, some of you are safe because you don't have email to start with. During the past 18 months I have received emails admittedly more against Barrak Obama than John McCain or Sarah Palin, many centered on Obama's race or Palin's gender, but I want to highlight two, one from each side. There were emails about Obama that talked about him not being a citizen because he was born in Kenya."

"There were emails about Obama that talked about him not being a citizen because he was born in Kenya. According to the email Obama's grandmother was present for the birth and swears he was born in Kenya. Yet the email conveniently leaves out the idea that there are two ways that one can be considered to be a natural born citizen."
"If we are actually born in the United States or, if at least one of our parents are citizens or the US. There has never been a question that Obama's mother was a US Citizen. It seems evident to me that whoever started this was intent on putting Obama in a negative light."
"There has never been a question that Obama's mother was a US Citizen. It seems evident to me that whoever started this was intent on putting Obama in a negative light. The other I want to mention is about Sarah Palin."
"There were emails that went around saying that this child was not Palin's baby, but her daughter's child. Now, there is no evidence of that being true, it is just what some people were saying in an effort to hurt the McCain-Palin campaign. These emails are by no means alone."
"Through both good and bad, our country has survived each. Will President-elect Obama be a good president. Only time will tell."
"It just means that we act in love, prayer, and support until what they say or do go against the word of God. I am sure that some of you are sitting there and saying, Well Keith must be an Obama guy and now he wants us all to support Obama. Well the truth is, you don't know who I voted for and you aren't going to know."
"Obviously I couldn't finish it until I knew who won the election. Friends, this message is my effort, and would have been virtually identical had John McCain won the election, to see the hate stop among our citizens but even more among people of faith. I pray that I never see or hear about another situation like Mike and Buddy again."
"- he Got up - nullifying deaths finality. - kicking Satan to the curb - eliminating his power - removing his trump card. - allowing us to come out of hiding - and letting us run to the safety place - Salvation."
"And, so it goes for them and, for us. I feel relatively certain Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, or any of the other 32 official candidates for the presidency did you know there is a candidate named Joseph Maldonado whose name will appear on the ballot in Oklahoma as Joe Exotic. believe they will do their best to lead our nation through these challenging times."
"And a quick side note on that issue: We need to show respect for the political leaders in our nation as well, and pray for them, regardless of whether we voted for them or not. I have always respected George Bush and prayed for his leadership of our country. And if and when Barack Obama is sworn is as president, I will show respect and pray for his leadership of our country as well."

"In his book, Bennett shows people how to succeed at being a public espouser of Biblically based virtues. He railed about American's broken moral compass as an academic in the 1970s; he carried on preaching morality when he was Ronald Reagan's education secretary and George Bush's drug czar. His 1992 best seller book has made him a millionaire several times over and has spawned a mini-business: book sequels, calendars, videos, stickers, speeches at 40,000 for an appearance."
"He remains an outstanding example of a media darling who is a moralist in the age of determined relativists. While many are insisting that what President Clinton does in his private life is his own business Bennett objects to that saying, If Americans suspend judgment of such behavior they have lost the capacity to make moral judgments about anything. He insists that without a morally guided capacity, Americans might not have ended slavery, outlawed child-labor or mobilized itself against communism."

"-One of the candidates answered with a very strong religious statement. It wasn't George Bush because he answered, I don't know -It was Senator John Kerry who said - We're all God's children, he said. And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was."
"Again, Gods answer was more about the how than just the what. Bobby Clinton wrote a book several years ago called The Making of a Leader. In this book he goes through the formative steps that God uses, the processes that God engages in, in making someone into a leader."
"I still remember how my Senior Pastor interpreted this verse thirty-five years ago he said it means we are to be known for our sweet reasonableness. Senator John McCain demonstrated civility on Friday night when during a town hall meeting in Minnesota, some in the crowd became uncivil and churlish in their remarks. Senator McCain was booed when he responded by defending Barack Obama as a decent family man and citizen with whom he has differences regarding the fundamental issues of the campaign."

"Those who support a different candidate from us are not our enemies. Trump and Biden are not our enemies.

"Douglas K. Daniel, Biden calls paying higher taxes a patriotic act, Associated Press, September 18, 2008 In our culture, it seems to be a question of who gets tax relief the wealthy and big business or the middle class. Pledges to lower taxes are welcomed and promises to raise taxes not so much."
"The political columnist capitalizing on the oft used references to the campaigners' willingness to fight, continued, For a punch to make a difference the punch needs to do something to the target to rattle, to wound, or cause him to counter punch in a self-defeating way. Patrick Healy, McCain Attacks but Obama Steady, New York Times, Politics, October 18, 2008 In our story today the religious leaders are trying to goad Jesus into saying something that would either get him arrested by the Roman governmental authorities or discredit himself with his Jewish community.

"The abortion issue is a great issue in the presidential discussions.

"Don't vote for someone because they are male or female or because they are friends of friends - and don't vote for a person based on their political party - vote for people because of the values they stand for.

"1 PETER 2:13 - Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men: Whether to the king as the supreme authority or to governors who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.

"And I do my very best to remember Him through His Son, Jesus Christ, and to focus on Him first and foremost in my life.

This is a time of healing and refocusing on our Lord, not a time of bitterness and negativity."

"I have had several conversations not necessarily of my choosing with people from both sides, some expressing hope while others expressing dismay.

"My response to this, while not popular, is this: if you continue to live in America and enjoy the freedoms that made it possible for Mr. Trump to win the election according to the current rules in place, then I am sorry to inform you that yes, he will definitely be your president.

"Paul modeled this very thing for us: In Acts 23, a corrupt high priest attacks him, but Paul cites the scripture saying that the high priest should be respected for his office. When Bill Clinton was president, he did some of the most disrespectful things a president might do, but he was still due respect because of the position he held. You might have a boss who has a filthy mouth, has a bad temper, and a warped sense of humor."
"And regardless of who is in power, we need to pray for our leaders. Whether McCain or Obama wins the election, the new president needs our prayers just as President Bush does now. You might say, but what if they are not a good leader."

Our culture has made personal rights to trump God's laws, meaning, a person has the constitutional right which is certainly not specified in the constitution of the USA to take the right of one's own unborn baby for no better reason than I don't want this baby or this pregnancy. The political platform of the Democratic Party supports the right of a woman to kill their own unborn child, including partial abortion, and abortion of an infant to full term."
